You are given a string where you have to find its first word.

When solving a task pay attention to the following points:

There can be dots and commas in a string.
A string can start with a letter or, for example, a dot or space.
A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.

Input: A string.
Output: A string.
